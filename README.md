### How to set up

you need the correct version of Java and sbt. The template requires:

Java Software Developer's Kit (SE) 1.8 or higher

sbt 1.3.4 or higher. Note: if you downloaded this project as a zip file from https://developer.lightbend.com, the file includes an sbt distribution for your convenience.

To build and run the project:

Use a command window to change into the example project directory, for example: cd FinalFrontend
Build the project. Enter: sbt run. The project builds and starts the embedded HTTP server. Since this downloads libraries and dependencies, the amount of time required depends partly on your connection's speed.
After the message Server started, ... displays, enter the following URL in a browser: http://localhost:9000
